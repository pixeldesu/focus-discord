# Focus
Focus is a theme for Vencord/BetterDiscord, very opinionatedly reducing distractions present in the application.

_It should most likely work with other themes because it mainly removes things from the UI._

## Installation

Just copy the `focus.theme.css` file to your BetterDiscord/Vencord theme directory.

## But why?

Messaging others shouldn't be dictated on what the other person is doing at the moment. When we need something from them, we should go ahead and ask. If the person isn't available, they will reply once they are.

Read/typing indicators, people being online but not answering or  people not answering quickly enough albeit possibly seeing our message are all things that spike anxieties in some users, even though they shouldn't. People don't need to be available to us 24/7, and so shouldn't we to them.

This is why this theme removes so many of those features, to improve ones digital wellbeing. A lot of other chat apps offer hiding a lot of the features already, Discord doesn't.
